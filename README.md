# Traffic-Sign-Classification

In this group project we implemented various architectures available in Keras to classify 43 different traffic signs using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. Then we compared the accuracy and the speed of these architectures and compiled a report, which can be found in the documentation folder.
